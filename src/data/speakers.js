    description:
      "Tim Stone is an accidental pastor by God's sense of humour. Tim grew up in Indonesia and the Philippines and saw firsthand huge regions without access to the Gospel of Christ. While working and in his 20s, Tim did not have a clear call to missions. Instead of pursuing a doctoral degree in Physics, he decided to take the first step to 'volunteer' overseas to do the busy-work alongside the 'real' missionaries who were doing the 'spiritual work'. Tim and his family were finishing up language school in Istanbul in 2007 when there was a triple torture-murder of a Turkish pastor and two other Christian workers in the city of Malatya, Turkey. The widows of the Christian men publicly forgave the murderers in the name of Jesus, which was a wonderful testimony of what walking with Christ really meant. Tim and his family moved into that city, thinking that they would be a temporary help to the church. When the real missionaries did not return, Tim ended up from being the 'crisis' guy to being ordained as Pastor Tim. The small church recovered by God's grace and was even able to plant more small churches in the South-East of Turkey. Tim and his family are currently working on a new project that is planting churches in the least-reached North-East of Turkey and in the neighbouring country of Azerbaijan. There has always been opposition to the Gospel and death threats were frequently made. There has been at least one instance where Tim and his family were close to martyrdom but God supernaturally protected them. It is to this that Tim will testify.",
